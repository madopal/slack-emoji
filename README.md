Emoji to put in slack

Please check for existing images before spamming with dupes. However, if there is a "better" image than the one, commit a branch against it & I can approve.

Naming convention: please name any emoji with roughly the name they should use to be used, i.e. "greenguy.png".

Format: Keep them Slack-compatible, which should be roughly square, have a transparent background, and < 128k
